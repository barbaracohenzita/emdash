> Emdash uses AI to organize text snippets so you can actually remember & learn
> from what you read.

## Features

### Conceptual cousins

On-device AI analysis finds passages with similar ideas from other authors,
often from a different angle.

### Instant semantic search

Find what youÊ¼re looking for with both full-text search and deeper semantic
matching of fuzzy ideas.

### Tag, rate, note, reflect

Organize with tags, add ratings, and annotate your thoughts. Export back to epub
for review on your e-reader.

### Roll the dice, change your lens

Unearth ideas youÊ¼ve forgotten about via random discovery. Rephrase dense
concepts and re-explain with metaphors.

### No lock-in

Bring in your highlights from your Kindle or as json, csv, or manual input.
Export instantly to the same open formats.

### Open-source & offline first

On-device analysis means your collection stays on your device until you opt into
advanced features.
